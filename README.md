# simple_contracts
Here they lie... simple .sol contracts I used to learn Solidity language. 
This stuff is used by me to compile more complex programs without re-writing this every time.

Feel free to pick those lines up and modify them to your contracts, based on your purpose. ðŸ¥°

 ## This repo includes:
1. A simple Save & Return string program.
2. A counter (saving, adding, resetting a uint value).
3. A register example (here I used students).
4. A Bank contract, used to deposit and withdraw Ether.
5. A simple Lottery contract

## How to use
Just copy my code and modifiy it as you wish, but always remember to:
1. Put the License in every of them as a comment in firs lines.
2. Specify a unique preagma solidity version, to secure the contract from future updates.

ðŸ”¥ Have a nice day king ðŸ”¥
